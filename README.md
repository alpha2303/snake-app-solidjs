# Snake App on SolidJS

Basic implementation of the popular Snake game using SolidJS and TypeScript.

Inspired by [Coding Challenges #57](https://codingchallenges.substack.com/p/coding-challenge-57-snake).

## Setup
1. Ensure you have the latest version of NodeJS (LTS preferred) installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/alpha2303/snake-app-solidjs.git
    ```
2. Install the required node modules using `npm install`.
3. To run development server, open a terminal in the repository folder and run `npm run dev`.

## Known Issues and Feature Requirements
- [ ] Code allows reverse direction by hitting intermediate direction before reverse.
- [ ] Food can generate on boxes where snake currently exists
- [ ] Game Reset Logic
- [ ] Speed Increase Logic
- [ ] Event handler stops working if div contains SolidJS components (Show, Switch/Match)
